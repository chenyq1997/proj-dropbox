# proj-dropbox
An attempt to implement a dropbox-style storage, in which files are stored in form of fixed-size chunks. Same chunks will be stored only once to save space.
The implementation will be in C/C++.

Target functions:
1. Load a new file into the master storage.
2. List all files in the master storage.
3. Retrieve a file from the master storage.
4. Delete a file in the master storage.
5. (Extra) Develop a GUI.

The data structures and functions are outlined in "EC504Project2.pdf".
